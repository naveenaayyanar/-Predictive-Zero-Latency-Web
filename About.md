**About the Project: Predictive Zero-Latency Web Application**

**What it is:**
An AI-powered web project that predicts the next webpage a user will visit and prefetches it to simulate **instant, zero-latency browsing**. It uses **LSTM neural networks** to learn sequential user navigation patterns and provides real-time predictions with measurable metrics.

**Why it matters (Need/Importance):**

* Traditional web navigation always has **visible latency**, especially on dynamic or large websites.
* Prefetching pages without prediction wastes bandwidth; predicting user behavior **optimizes performance**.
* Provides a **hands-on educational tool** for students and developers to understand AI applied to real-world web performance.
* Demonstrates a novel intersection of **AI, networking, and web development** — rarely explored in open-source projects.

**How it works:**

1. **Data Collection:** Simulated or real user navigation logs are prepared.
2. **Training:** An **LSTM model** is trained to learn sequences of page visits (`current → next`).
3. **Prediction:** When a user visits a page, the model predicts the next page and simulates prefetch.
4. **Metrics Tracking:** Tracks **prediction accuracy**, **prefetch hit ratio**, and **latency saved**.
5. **Web Integration:** Flask app demonstrates predictions with HTML templates and CSS styling.

**Key Unique Features:**

* **Predictive Prefetch:** Unlike standard recommendation systems, this predicts the next action **before it happens**.
* **Zero-Latency Simulation:** Users experience near-instant page loads for correctly predicted pages.
* **Custom Metrics:** Real-time evaluation of model performance (accuracy, hits, latency).
* **Extensibility:** Easily retrainable on new website navigation data.
* **Open-Source Friendly:** Includes a **Colab notebook, trained model, and encoder**, allowing others to replicate or extend the project.

**When & Who Can Use It:**

* College students learning **AI, web development, or networking**.
* Developers experimenting with **predictive web performance**.
* Anyone interested in **real-time user behavior prediction** and optimization.
