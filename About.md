 **Project Description**

**Predictive Zero-Latency Web Application** is an AI-powered web project designed to **predict the next webpage a user will visit** and prefetch it, making navigation feel almost instantaneous. This project demonstrates the practical application of **LSTM neural networks** in real-time web optimization.

The project simulates **zero-latency browsing** by predicting user behavior and updating metrics like **prefetch hits, prediction accuracy, and average latency**, providing both a functional web demo and a performance analytics dashboard.

It’s an **educational, open-source project**, suitable for college students, AI enthusiasts, and web developers interested in integrating **machine learning with real-time web applications**.

# **Key Features**

* **Next-Page Prediction:** Uses an LSTM model to predict the next page based on current navigation.
* **Prefetch Simulation:** Simulates loading the predicted page in advance to reduce perceived latency.
* **Metrics Dashboard:** Tracks total clicks, prefetch hits, hit ratio, and average latency in real-time.
* **Auto-Redirect:** Automatically navigates users to the predicted next page after a short delay, demonstrating zero-latency behavior.
* **Easy Integration:** Built with Flask, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Python, making it easy to run locally or extend.
* **Educational Use:** Includes a Google Colab notebook for retraining the LSTM model with custom navigation logs.
