**Why This Project Is Unique**

This project is a **Predictive Zero-Latency Web Application**, combining AI, networking, and web development in a way rarely seen in open-source projects.

* **Predictive Web Navigation:** Unlike typical recommendation systems, this project **predicts the next page a user will visit** and prefetches it to simulate zero-latency browsing.
* **AI + Networking Integration:** Uses **LSTM neural networks** to learn user navigation patterns, bridging sequential AI modeling with web performance optimization.
* **Custom Metrics Tracking:** Includes **prediction accuracy, prefetch hit ratio, and average latency saved**, providing measurable insights into performance.
* **Extensible & Educational:** Users can **retrain the model with their own navigation data** to experiment with real-world scenarios.
* **Hands-on Demo:** Comes with a **Flask web interface** demonstrating predictions and prefetch simulation in real time.

âœ… This combination of **real-time prediction, prefetching, and performance metrics** makes it a novel, educational, and open-source-ready project.
