**Key Features**

* **Next-Page Prediction:** Uses an LSTM model to predict the next page based on current navigation.
* **Prefetch Simulation:** Simulates loading the predicted page in advance to reduce perceived latency.
* **Metrics Dashboard:** Tracks total clicks, prefetch hits, hit ratio, and average latency in real-time.
* **Auto-Redirect:** Automatically navigates users to the predicted next page after a short delay, demonstrating zero-latency behavior.
* **Easy Integration:** Built with Flask, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Python, making it easy to run locally or extend.
* **Educational Use:** Includes a Google Colab notebook for retraining the LSTM model with custom navigation logs.
